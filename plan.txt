That’s an **excellent project idea** — you’re on the perfect path 👏

A **blog + user social interest** system gives you almost every real-world backend concept you’ll need to master (and professional backend dev work).

Let’s break this down strategically so you **learn authentication, sessions, aggregations, and advanced backend patterns** in a structured way.

## 🚀 Your Project Vision (and What You’ll Learn)

| Feature                            | Backend Concept You’ll Learn                             | Why It’s Important for Interviews  |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 🔐 **Authentication & Sessions**   | JWT, NextAuth, Cookies, Refresh Tokens                   | Core backend topic — always asked  |
| 👥 **User profiles & relations**   | MongoDB schema design, normalization vs denormalization  | Tests DB modeling skills           |
| 🧠 **Blog posts, likes, comments** | CRUD APIs, aggregation pipelines, data joins (`$lookup`) | MongoDB and data logic mastery     |
| 🔎 **Search & recommendation**     | Text indexes, aggregation stages, scoring                | Common system design question      |
| 🪪 **Roles (admin, user)**         | Access control & middleware                              | Tests understanding of security    |
| ⚙️ **Performance tuning**          | Caching, pagination, indexing                            | Practical backend scaling concepts |

## 🧱 Phase 1: Authentication & Session Handling (Foundations)

### 🧩 What to Learn / Implement

* `bcryptjs` → hashing passwords
* `jsonwebtoken` → generating JWT tokens
* `next-auth` → for OAuth + session persistence
* Create `lib/jwt.ts` & `lib/session.ts` → handle `verifyToken`, `getCurrentSession`
* Store JWT in **HTTP-only cookies** (secure)
* Add middleware to protect `/dashboard`, `/posts/create`

### 📦 What You’ll Build

✅ `/auth/register` → create user
✅ `/auth/login` → issue JWT
✅ `/dashboard` → protected route
✅ `/api/auth/session` → return logged-in user

You’ll fully understand:

* How sessions persist
* How to secure routes
* Difference between **JWT vs NextAuth session**

---

## 📚 Phase 2: Database Modeling (Users + Posts + Interests)

### 🧩 Collections to Create

#### 1. `users`

```js
{
  _id,
  name,
  email,
  password,
  hobbies: [ "coding", "music" ],
  interests: [ "AI", "React" ],
  followers: [userId],
  following: [userId],
  createdAt,
}
```

#### 2. `posts`

```js
{
  _id,
  authorId,
  title,
  content,
  tags: ["AI", "React"],
  likes: [userId],
  commentsCount,
  createdAt,
}
```

#### 3. `comments`

```js
{
  _id,
  postId,
  authorId,
  text,
  createdAt,
}
```

✅ Learn:

* Referencing (`authorId` → `users._id`)
* Indexing on `tags`, `authorId`
* MongoDB schema normalization

---

## 🧮 Phase 3: Aggregations (The Most Interviewed Topic!)

Aggregation = MongoDB’s **version of SQL joins and analytics**.

### 🔧 Learn & Implement:

* `$match`, `$group`, `$sort`, `$limit`
* `$lookup` → joins between users & posts
* `$addFields`, `$project`, `$unwind`
* `$facet` → pagination and filtering together

### 🧠 Examples You’ll Build:

* Get top 5 users with most posts
* Get trending tags
* Get user’s posts with comment count
* Get “recommended users” (same hobbies/interests)
* Search blogs with partial text match and sort by popularity

### 📘 Sample Query

```js
db.posts.aggregate([
  { $lookup: { from: "users", localField: "authorId", foreignField: "_id", as: "author" } },
  { $unwind: "$author" },
  { $project: { title: 1, "author.name": 1, tags: 1, likesCount: { $size: "$likes" } } },
  { $sort: { likesCount: -1 } },
  { $limit: 10 }
])
```

---

## 🧑‍💻 Phase 4: Backend Architecture for Real Projects

You’ll move from **simple CRUD** to **clean, scalable structure**.

### 🏗️ Structure

```
app/
  api/
    auth/
      login/route.ts
      register/route.ts
    posts/
      route.ts          // GET all posts
      create/route.ts   // POST new post
  dashboard/
    page.tsx

lib/
  jwt.ts
  session.ts
  mongodb.ts
  validations.ts

models/
  user.ts
  post.ts
  comment.ts
```

✅ Learn:

* API versioning (`/api/v1/...`)
* DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)
* Validation via `zod` or `yup`
* CQRS-style separation of read/write

## ⚡ Phase 5: Advanced Concepts (for Interviews)

| Concept        | Example / Practice                      | Why It Matters                  |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Middleware     | Auth protection, logging                | Shows control over request flow |
| Caching        | Redis / local memory for trending posts | Optimizing reads                |
| Pagination     | Limit, skip, cursor-based pagination    | Common interview problem        |
| Error handling | Centralized error middleware            | Real-world maintainability      |
| Testing        | Jest or Supertest for APIs              | Demonstrates reliability focus  |

Would you like me to create a **roadmap with tasks and milestones** (like a Trello board or checklist) for this full backend learning project — with links to key topics (auth, session, aggregation, etc.)?

That’ll help you go step by step and ensure you master every backend concept properly.
